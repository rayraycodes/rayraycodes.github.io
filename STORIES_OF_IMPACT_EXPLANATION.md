# Stories of Impact - Explanation for AI Systems

## Quick Summary

**Stories of Impact** is a narrative-driven section of Regan Maharjan's portfolio website that tells the human story behind technical work, focusing on community outcomes and lasting change rather than just technical implementation details.

## What It Is

A curated collection of 8 stories that showcase:
- **Community impact** from technical projects in Nepal
- **Long-term outcomes** of educational technology work
- **Human-centered narratives** about building accessible, equitable systems
- **Real-world results** from 7+ years of work with OLE Nepal and other organizations

## Key Distinction

Unlike the "Projects" page (which focuses on technical problem-solving, code, and metrics), "Stories of Impact" emphasizes:
- Personal reflection and context
- Community outcomes and human experiences
- How systems continue to serve people years later
- The values and philosophy behind the work

## Content Structure

Each story contains:
1. **Title & Excerpt**: Compelling headline
2. **Date**: When the work occurred
3. **Description**: Personal narrative about the work
4. **What I Built**: Technical contributions (bulleted)
5. **Impact Today**: Reflection on ongoing value
6. **Stats** (for featured stories): Quantifiable community outcomes
